# Communications

## Introduction

Communication is critical in any organization but in doing so, we want to ensure that we are considerate of other people's production processes and time. If done well, we can streamline any processes or tools so that they enable us in our creative endeavours, while still facilitating useful knowledge exchange.

## Tools used for Communication

We use a few tools to communicate with our customers and teams: Slack, Github, G Suite, Asana and Miro.

### Slack
Our primary tool for communication where one can message, ping or ask questions to team members in channels depending on projects, interests and teams e.g. #snoke #random #general

### Github
Our primary technical tool, where one can not only see the actual contents of the codebase, but also more in-depth technical documentation related to specific modules. Documentation can take the form of:

 - README
 - Wiki
 - Issues

### G Suite
 1. **Gmail:** used for client and team correspondence
 2. **Calendar:** used for setting up meetings by creating an event invitation & booking one of the available rooms
 3. **Docs:** used for higher-level technical documentation (e.g. glossaries, interactions between components, brainstorming) and business context (e.g. common client use-cases, tutorials)

### Asana
Commonly used for project management and any other processes that lend themselves to the task-oriented interface (e.g Locus Builder Redesign, Office Availability, Weekly Meetings, etc.). As much as possible, this should be used to orchestrate a project, while providing links to more detailed documents (i.e. Docs, Github and Miro).

### Miro
A collaborative visual tool that can be used for project planning, remote meetings and other interactive sessions, such as real-time design or voting. A great way to connect component visualization with technical documentation.

## Opt-in & Opt-out

Join Slack channels, Google calendars and Asana projects that are relevant to you or that interest you. Similarly, feel free to leave channels, calendars and projects as needed.

## Choosing appropriate tools

Our communication tools encompass both formal and informal communications so we may want to consider the following factors:
* Your audience
	* Who and When - be sensitive to the workflows of others
	* Size - is this relevant to one person or a whole team?
	* What - Locus, Atom, Data or Product
* Content of message and reusability
	* Will this message be useful to someone else in the future?

In general, if it’s applicable to more than one person, share in Slack, Asana, Drive or Miro so it can be searchable and found in an accessible manner. For example, when getting into a longer discussion in Slack, respond in a Thread and change the first message to include, "*Thread: [topic of the thread]*", for easy searching and, in the future, parsing. Within the thread, add tags to messages, such as "*Summary: ...*", "*Question: ...*", and "*TODO: ...*", when useful.

Each person communicates and receives information differently, so you are encouraged to find out (Slack status or ask) how someone would be like to be contacted. e.g. ping on Slack vs. Asking in person.

When in doubt, use Slack.

## Practices
Intertwined amongst all of these tools are some common usages that have developed over time. They are not rules, rather practices some have agreed make their lives easier and as such are mostly **opt-in**. Some examples are:

 - Dev Journal
 - Slack Threads
 - Asana + Google Drive Knowledge Base

All of these are open to change since their goal is purely to optimize our work environment. If you have suggestions for how to improve them or have your own you'd like to try out, go for it. While doing so, remember to be the champion of your own cause. Since you're the person trying to invoke change, lead the way. Suggest it to the team, show them how it adds value and encourage them to try it out. Do not just throw out an idea and expect it to catch fire. Be persistent.

## Meetings

If a meeting is necessary, we have meeting spaces that can be pre-booked and used appropriately. Please be mindful of the duration time and goal for the meeting as we presently have limited private space for meetings and others might be waiting in line. If you’d like to get tips on how to ensure a productive meeting, click [here](https://github.com/EQWorks/common/productive-meeting.md).

Meeting notes should be shared across for all participants and anyone else who might be interested in the contents but couldn’t attend. Feel free to post in appropriate Slack channels, Asana projects, Drives or Miro Boards.

Try to summarize your notes in a meaningful and templated way, for example:

	Agenda
	Misc. Notes
	Questions
	TODO
	Summary

## Balancing work with communication

Maintaining communication can easily distract from other work, so time management is important. For example, how you manage your notifications can greatly increase or decrease your productivity. Each person has a unique set of communication preferences that work for them. For example:
* If you prefer to work on contiguous blocks uninterrupted, then allocate yourself a daily cadence to check and respond to messages - there is a Do Not Disturb Mode you can activate if you’d like
* If you prefer to multitask, then feel free to keep all communications open

If you are unsure about how you can balance work and maintain communication, click [here](https://github.com/EQWorks/common/communication-practices.md) for more information on best practices that have been suggested. Feel free to see what works for you.
