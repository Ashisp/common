# Communications

## General guidelines

Communication is critical to any organization and in doing so, we should be considerate of other people's production processes and time.
We use a few tools to aid customer and team (inter and intra) communication: Slack, G Suite, Asana and Emails.

Our communication tools encompasses both formal and informal communications as such we may want to understand:

- your audience 
- the size of the audience 
- content of message and reusability (if the content of the message will come in handy in the future) 

and then choose the appropriate communication tools to ensure effective communication.

Time management is key to success and so is effective communication. Sometimes communication tools can reduce productivity time hence, we can individually implement suitable patterns to ensure we effciently and effectively manage our time.

Feel free to verbally ask colleagues what means they will like to be communicated through and utilize any of our communication tools with all professionalism.

#### Importantly
- Be very obscure when you communicate common credentials or secrets. We have a well-controlled private channels for this.


#### - Project Management & Product Issue Documentation: Asana -

Our Asana workspace is commonly used for project management e.g task allocation, task state (in progress or completed), and any other process we deem it fit to be used for (e.g Office Availability, calender scheduling, etc.)
Opt-in to join projects/tasks that you are interested in or obligated to.


#### Meetings
If a meeting is necessary, we have a meeting space that can be pre-booked and used appropriately. Please be mindful of the duration time as we presently have limited private space for meetings and others might be waiting in line.

###### Events Tool: Google Calendar -
Opt-in to subscribe to calendars you are interested in or obligated to.
You can set up meetings by using event invitations and book one of the available rooms in the google invitation to avoid disappointment.

###### Preparing for & During Meetings: 
To ensure that meetings are productive and are respectful of everyone's time and productivity, feel free to try out the steps below:

1. Timebox meeting to ensure the duration is convenient for every or most participants.
2. Write down the agenda, and prepare every participant by sending the agenda out before the meeting.
3. Demonstrate the problem, perhaps on-site or screen-shared. Try to keep to the proposed timeboxed duration for the meeting.
4. Ensure there are clear and concise takeaways. In the absence of any, feel free to continue remotely while considering productive time factor of every participant.
5. Ensure to take meeting notes and itemize key points.

This is not an exhaustive or compulsive steps to follow but it could guide you to an effective meeting and usage of meeting space in the abscence of a meeting plan/guide

###### - Meeting Documentation:
Meeting notes should be shared accross for both participants and anyone else who might be interested in the contents but couldn't attend/join the meeting.
