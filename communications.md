# Communications

## Introduction

Communication is critical in any organization but in doing so, we want to ensure that we are considerate of other people's production processes and time. If done well, we can facilitate great knowledge exchange while still being able to do good work.

## Tools used for Communication

We use a few tools to aid customer and team (inter and intra) communication: Slack, G Suite and Asana.

Slack is our primary tool for communication where one can message, ping or ask questions to team members in channels depending on projects, interests and teams e.g. #snoke #random #general

G Suite consists of 1) Gmail, used for client and team correspondence and 2) Calendar, used for setting up meetings by creating an event invitation & booking one of the available rooms.

Asana is commonly used for project management and any other processes we deem it fit to be used for (e.g Locus Builder Redesign, Office Availability, Weekly Meetings, etc.)

## Opt-in & Opt-out

Join Slack channels, Google calendars and Asana projects that you are obligated to or are interested in joining. Similarly, feel free to leave channels, calendars and projects you are no longer required to stay or are interested in.

## Choosing appropriate tools

Our communication tools encompasses both formal and informal communications so we may want to consider the following factors:
* Your audience (Is this important to the Locus team or Atom team?)
* The size of the audience (Is this relevant to one person or a whole team?)
* Content of message and reusability (Will this message be useful to someone else in the future?)

In general, if it’s applicable to more than one person, share in the relevant Slack channel or Asana project so it can be searchable and found in an accessible manner. For example, asking questions in a Slack channel allow responses to those questions to become part of our knowledge base. Only exception is sharing common credentials or secrets - we have a well-controlled private channel for this.

Each person communicates and receives information differently so if something requires attention, feel free to verbally ask colleagues or check their Slack status for how they would be like to be communicated. e.g. ping on Slack versus asking in person.

When there is doubt, use Slack.

## Meetings

If a meeting is necessary, we have meeting spaces that can be pre-booked and used appropriately. Please be mindful of the duration time and goal for the meeting as we presently have limited private space for meetings and others might be waiting in line. If you’d like to get tips on how to ensure a productive meeting, click [here](https://github.com/EQWorks/common/productive-meeting.md).

Meeting notes should be shared across for all participants and anyone else who might be interested in the contents but couldn’t attend. Feel free to post in appropriate Slack channels or Asana projects.

## Balancing work with communication

Consequently while maintaining communication, it can take away time for work so time management is important. For example, how you manage your notifications can greatly increase or decrease your productivity. Each person has a unique set of communication preferences that work for them. For example:
* If you prefer to work on contiguous blocks uninterrupted, then allocate yourself a daily cadence to check and respond to messages - there is a Do Not Disturb Mode you can activate if you’d like
* If you prefer to multitask, then feel free to keep all communications open

If you are unsure about how you can balance work and maintain communication, click [here](https://github.com/EQWorks/common/communication-practices.md) for more information on best practices that have been suggested. Feel free to see what works for you.
